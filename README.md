Hello everyone.
This is a project on FastAPI, with fully asynchronous code, based on a microservices architecture and a monorepo. 
The project uses Docker and Docker Compose for CI/CD deployment. 
There are two microservices that handle user authentication, with JSON Web Token (JWT). 
Additionally, there is a microservice that handles user information. 
These microservices interact with each other through API calls, which helps maintain loose coupling between the microservices. 
This project has been a great opportunity for me to learn about microservices architecture for the first time and see how it can benefit large-scale projects, 
as well as become familiar with some important tools such as Docker, Docker Compose, and FastAPI. Through this project, 
I have gained valuable insights into the development process and the modern technologies that are used to deliver complex applications in a scalable and efficient way.

Now the project structure looks like this:
